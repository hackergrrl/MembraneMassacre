Membrane Massacre
=================

Overview
========
A 2D shooter: pilot a miniturized ship and blast bacteria in deliciously destructible enviornments.

Status
======
Initially developed on and for solely Windows, my current goal is to get the came compiled and fully functional on Linux and OS X (as well as whatever other platforms others are interested in). The game was originally written in 2006-2007 when I knew far less C, so part of the upcoming work will also include cleaning up various bugs and mistakes.

After the basic game functionality is present on all three platforms, the next step will be to move the game's renderer from Allegro 4.2 (software renderer) to either Allegro 5 or SDL/OpenGL -- both provide a means to interfacing with OpenGL, which will make the game more portable to the wide variety of mobile platforms via OpenGL ES.
